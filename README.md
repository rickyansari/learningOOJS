Learning object oriented javascript

## OOP is a pardigm for structuring our complex code
- Easy to add features and functionality.
- Easy for us and other developer to reason about(a clear structure).
- Performant (efficient in term of memory).

We need to organize our code as it gets more complex so it's not just endless series of commmands.

``` 
Objects- store functions with their associated data!

const user = {
  name: "Phil",
  score: 4,
  increament: function(){
      user.score++
  }
} 

This is the principal of encapsulation.
```
